# 🛡️ CyberTrust-AI-Forensic-Cybersecurity System

**HackSecureX-AI-Forensic-Cybersecurity System** is an AI-assisted digital forensics system developed for the **HackSecureX International Hackathon 2026**.  
The project addresses real-world challenges at the intersection of **cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, and cyber law** by ensuring that AI-based forensic analysis remains **legally defensible and trustworthy**.It integrates ML–based log analysis with cryptographic evidence locking to detect cyber incidents while preserving data integrity.

## 🚀 Project Motivation

Modern cybersecurity tools increasingly rely on AI to detect and analyze attacks.  
However, most AI-driven systems fail to preserve legal evidence integrity, making their results difficult to trust in audits, investigations, or legal proceedings.

This project bridges that gap by linking **AI forensic analysis** with **cryptographic chain-of-custody enforcement**, ensuring that:

- Evidence is not altered  
- Every action is auditable  
- AI insights remain legally admissible  

## 🧠 Key Features

#### 🔒 Evidence Locking  
Digital evidence is cryptographically hashed at upload time to prevent tampering.

#### 🤖 AI-Based Forensic Analysis  
Machine learning is used to analyze log data, detect anomalies, and reconstruct forensic timelines.

#### 📜 Chain of Custody Enforcement  
Every action (upload, AI analysis, verification) is logged with timestamps to ensure traceability.

#### 🔍 Integrity Verification  
Evidence integrity is re-verified before and after AI access.

#### 📄 Forensic Report Generation  
Automatically generates a downloadable, human-readable forensic report.

#### 🎭 Demo Mode vs Forensic Mode  
Clean demo sessions for presentations, with persistent custody tracking for realistic forensic use.

## 🌍 Real-World Use Cases

This system is designed for scenarios where **technical accuracy and legal trust must coexist**:

- Cyber incident response and breach investigations  
- Digital forensics for law enforcement and legal teams  
- Regulatory compliance, audits, and cyber law reviews  
- Research on trustworthy and responsible AI in cybersecurity
